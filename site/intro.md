# Welcome to Applied Quantum and Quantum-Inspired Optimization

This Book introduces the world of **quantum** and **quantum-inspired optimization**, a rapidly growing field at the intersection of classical optimization, quantum computing, and applied mathematics.

## About This Book

The book is designed as a **practical guide** to understanding and applying quantum-inspired optimization methods.  
It draws on ideas from both research and industry practice, with contributions from [BQP](https://www.bqpsim.com/) and the [RPI Quantum Computing Initiative](https://dotcio.rpi.edu/rpi-quantum-computing).  

Rather than waiting for large-scale quantum computers to become widely accessible, **quantum-inspired approaches** make use of algorithms and techniques that are motivated by quantum mechanics but can run efficiently on today’s classical hardware.

## Why Quantum-Inspired Optimization?

Optimization problems are everywhere: from logistics and scheduling, to finance, drug discovery, and machine learning.  
Traditional methods often struggle as these problems scale.  

**Quantum-inspired optimization** provides a new toolkit:  
- Algorithms that mimic quantum principles  
- Methods that scale beyond classical solvers in certain settings  
- Approaches that bridge today’s computational capabilities with tomorrow’s quantum hardware
