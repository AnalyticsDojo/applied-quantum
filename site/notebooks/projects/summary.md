## Summary of Quantum Problems 
Here are 10 business problems that would fit well with a Quantum project, meaning they involve complex optimization, combinatorial decision-making, or probabilistic modeling where quantum or quantum-inspired algorithms could provide an advantage. I‚Äôve grouped them into domains to show variety:

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è 1. Supply Chain Optimization

Problem: Determine optimal routes, supplier choices, and production schedules to minimize cost and delivery times under uncertainty.
Quantum Angle: Formulate as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem for quantum annealing (e.g., using D-Wave).

üí∞ 2. Portfolio Optimization

Problem: Select a combination of assets that maximizes expected return and minimizes risk, considering constraints like diversification and liquidity.
Quantum Angle: Use quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA) or Ising model formulations for large-scale risk-return tradeoffs.
