    "## 1) Background: What is the TSP?\n",
    "The **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** asks: given a set of cities and distances between them, find the **shortest possible tour** that visits each city **exactly once** and returns to the starting city.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it's important**\n",
    "- It captures core ideas in **combinatorial optimization**.\n",
    "- It's **NP-hard**, so exact solutions scale poorly; heuristics and metaheuristics are key in practice.\n",
    "- TSP appears in logistics, routing drones/robots, circuit board design, DNA sequencing (as a model), and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Growth of possibilities**\n",
    "For `n` cities, the number of distinct tours is roughly `(n-1)!/2` (for undirected symmetric distances). Even `n=20` is astronomically large, so brute force is infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two families of approaches**\n",
    "- **Exact**: MILP/ILP with branch & bound, cutting planes, dynamic programming (e.g., Held–Karp). Guarantees optimality but limited scale.\n",
    "- **Heuristics/metaheuristics**: nearest neighbor, 2-opt/3-opt, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, ant colony, etc. Scales better; no optimality guarantee.\n"

    "## 🚗 Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) — Undirected Formulation (No MTZ)\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous examples, we used **linear programming (LP)** and **mixed-integer programming (MIP)** to model optimization problems such as fertilizer cost and field selection.  \n",
    "Now we revisit one of the most famous NP-hard problems: the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** — but this time, using a **pure undirected LP formulation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧭 Problem Overview\n",
    "Given a set of cities and distances between each pair, the goal is to find the **shortest possible tour** that:\n",
    "- Visits every city exactly once, and  \n",
    "- Returns to the starting city.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 Formulation (Undirected)\n",
    "We create one **binary variable** for each undirected edge:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "x_{ij} =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "1, & \\text{if edge between cities } i \\text{ and } j \\text{ is used in the tour,}\\\\\n",
    "0, & \\text{otherwise.}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\]\n",

    "**Objective:**\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Minimize } \\sum_{i<j} d_{ij} \\, x_{ij}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "1. **Degree constraints:**  \n",
    "   Each city must connect to exactly two other cities  \n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\sum_{i<k} x_{ik} + \\sum_{k<j} x_{kj} = 2, \\quad \\forall k\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "2. **Subtour elimination constraints:**  \n",
    "   To prevent disconnected loops, for any subset of cities \\( S \\) smaller than \\( n \\):\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\sum_{i<j,\\, i,j \\in S} x_{ij} \\le |S| - 1\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "These constraints ensure that the final solution forms a **single Hamiltonian cycle** through all cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Why “No MTZ”?\n",
    "The **MTZ formulation** adds extra variables (\\(u_i\\)) to eliminate subtours using directed constraints.  \n",
    "Here, we take a more direct, *undirected* approach:\n",
    "- We start with only the degree constraints.\n",
    "- After solving, if the solution includes multiple smaller cycles (subtours), we detect them.\n",
    "- We then **add additional constraints (cuts)** dynamically to remove those subtours.\n",
    "- This process repeats until there’s exactly **one connected tour** — the optimal solution.\n",

    "This iterative approach is conceptually simpler and shows how solvers can *refine* models by adding constraints dynamically, similar to **cutting-plane methods** used in modern optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ How It Works in Practice\n",
    "The implementation below:\n",
    "1. Builds the initial LP model with degree constraints.  \n",
    "2. Solves it to find the shortest set of edges satisfying those constraints.  \n",
    "3. Detects subtours (disconnected loops).  \n",
    "4. Adds a constraint (“cut”) forbidding each subtour.  \n",
    "5. Repeats until one full tour remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "When finished, we have the **optimal undirected TSP tour** and its total length — all without using the MTZ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Learning Connections\n",
    "| Concept | Link to Earlier Topics |\n",
    "|----------|------------------------|\n",
    "| Linear constraints | Same LP framework as before (objective + constraints) |\n",
    "| Binary decisions | Same as field selection (0–1 choices) |\n",
    "| Iterative refinement | Similar to penalty updates or constraint tightening |\n",
    "| NP-hardness | Another example of combinatorial optimization using LP tools |\n",
