    "A **vector** is one of the most fundamental mathematical objects we will encounter. \n",
    "In quantum computing, a vector represents the **state of a quantum system**. \n",

    "- For a qubit, this state is written as a column vector in a two-dimensional complex vector space.  \n",
    "  The “zero” state of a qubit is represented as the vector {math}`[1, 0]^T`, and the “one” state \n",
    "  as {math}`[0, 1]^T`. \n",
    "- More generally, a quantum state can be a linear combination of these basis states, such as \n",
    "  {math}`\\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle`, which is simply a vector with complex entries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The length, or **norm**, of a vector plays a critical role in quantum mechanics. The squared \n",
    "magnitudes of the vector entries represent **probabilities**, which must always sum to 1. For \n",
    "this reason, all valid quantum states are **normalized vectors** with unit length. Normalization \n",
    "ensures that when a measurement is performed, the total probability of all possible outcomes is \n",
    "exactly one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors also provide a geometric picture of quantum states. In the case of a single qubit, \n",
    "we can think of the vector as pointing in some direction in two-dimensional space (or \n",
    "equivalently on the surface of the Bloch sphere). For higher-dimensional systems, this \n",
    "geometric picture becomes abstract, but the idea that vectors encode the “configuration” \n",
